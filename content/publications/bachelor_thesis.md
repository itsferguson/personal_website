## Introduction

Machine learning models, particularly in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, are becoming increasingly powerful. Yet, they suffer from a critical limitation: **they forget**. When trained on new tasks or domains, models often lose their ability to perform previously learned tasksâ€”a phenomenon known as **catastrophic forgetting**. This problem becomes more pressing as NLP systems are expected to evolve alongside the ever-changing nature of human language.

In my recent **bachelor's thesis**, I explored how to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in NLP through **continual learning**. The goal? To enable **lifelong learning models** that can adapt to new information while retaining past knowledge. This post summarizes the key insights and contributions of my research, which formed the basis of my **bachelor thesis**.

## The Challenge of Continual Learning

Traditional NLP models follow a **pretrain-then-finetune** paradigm:

1. **Pretraining**: The model learns general language patterns from a massive corpus.
2. **Finetuning**: The model is adapted to a specific task (e.g., sentiment analysis or summarization).

Once fine-tuned, the model is **frozen**â€”it can no longer update its knowledge without being retrained on the full dataset. This is **inefficient** and **costly**, especially for large-scale transformer models.

**Continual Learning (CL)** offers an alternative. Instead of retraining from scratch, CL enables models to **learn sequentially** while retaining past knowledge. However, achieving this requires overcoming two major challenges:

- **Task-Incremental Learning (TIL)**: How can a model learn new NLP tasks without overwriting previous ones?
- **Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL)**: How can a model generalize across different domains (e.g., social media vs. news articles) without task labels?

## A New Framework for Continual Learning in NLP

To address these challenges, I developed a **continual learning framework** based on the **T5 model** (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer). This framework integrates:

### 1. **Adapter-Based Learning for Task-Incremental Learning**
Instead of updating the entire model, I employed **lightweight adapter modules**â€”small task-specific components that can be swapped in and out for different tasks. The adapters evaluated include:

- **Bottleneck Adapters** (best-performing method)
- **Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRA)**
- **Prefix-Tuning**

By isolating task-specific learning to adapters, the core model remains stable while efficiently learning multiple tasks **without forgetting**.

### 2. **Replay-Based Strategies for Domain-Incremental Learning**
For domain adaptation, the framework implements **replay-based continual learning**, where past training data is revisited to reinforce memory. Two strategies were tested:

- **Real Sampling**: Storing and replaying actual past training samples.
- **Pseudo Sampling**: Using the model itself to **generate synthetic samples** from past domains.

Pseudo-rehearsal allows models to retain knowledge **without explicitly storing past data**, which is crucial for privacy and scalability.

## Key Findings

The results of my **bachelor thesis** demonstrate:

- **Bottleneck adapters** achieved the best tradeoff between efficiency and performance.
- **Generative replay (pseudo-rehearsal)** proved effective in mitigating forgetting, though sample quality remains a challenge.
- The combination of **adapter-based TIL** and **replay-based DIL** provides a strong foundation for **lifelong NLP models**.

## The Future of Continual NLP

As **large language models (LLMs)** continue to evolve, continual learning will become **essential** to keep them relevant **without excessive retraining costs**. The research in this field is still in its early stages, but the potential impact is enormous.

Imagine an NLP system that **continuously improves** over time, adapting to new dialects, emerging slang, and domain-specific knowledgeâ€”all while retaining everything it has learned before.

That is the future of AI.
